# interactive-map-karlsruhe
Repository for an interactive map of Karlsruhe in the context of a project during master studies in computer scienc on University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe. 

## Demonstration of the interactive map
In this video you can see the full experience of the interactive map and the augmented reality interface with which the unser interacts.

## Folder structure
In this repository are two different versions of the interactive map. 
For the full experiece open the testwalk_deepvision folder, this version uses the camera, makes calibrations and detects the users hand for interakting with the map. In the folder you will find the applications you can run directly as well as the code base which can be opened with Processing. 
If you want to see the basic construct of the interactive map you can open the testwalk_mouse folder. Here you can exoerience the interactive map with your mouse. This is to explore the interactive elements without having to make a full setup at home. 

## How to use the application
On macbook M1 (or newer) you can use the application as it is. Clone the repository or just copy the folder with the application in it. 
On macbook with intel chip, windows or linux you can also just download the corresponding application folder. Note that you need a campatibla Java Version on your device (Java 17). If you don't have any, the application will tell you what you need. 

## How to see and execute the code
To use to code you need to install [Processing App] (https://processing.org). Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and language for designers and visual artists for prototyping applications. For ths project it is used to make an easy and fun-to-use graphical interface. Once you installed the Processing App you can open the code with it.
